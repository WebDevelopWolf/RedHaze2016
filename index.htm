                        He is part man, part wolf. He is terrorism’s worst enemy. His NATO codename is Red Haze and he is about to do battle with the greatest threat to European peace and stability, since the Second World War.
                        <br /><br />
                        A Special Air Service Recon Team parachute behind enemy lines at the beginning of Operation Telic, the British controlled section of the second allied invasion of Iraq. Bloody mayhem and chaos ensue, with Piper suddenly, unexpectedly transforming into a horrifying wolf-like creature, eviscerating and ripping his enemies to shreds whilst saving the lives of two of his terrified colleagues. But why has this happened, and what disturbing secret is the SAS Trooper withholding, a secret originating from within the darkest recesses of his boyhood past?

                        For Ash Piper and the wolf inside him…are not alone.
