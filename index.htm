                        He is part man, part wolf. He is terrorism’s worst enemy. His NATO codename is Red Haze and he is about to do battle with the greatest threat to European peace and stability, since the Second World War.
                        <br /><br />
                        A Special Air Service Recon Team parachute behind enemy lines at the beginning of Operation Telic, the British controlled section of the second allied invasion of Iraq. Bloody mayhem and chaos ensue, with Piper suddenly, unexpectedly transforming into a horrifying wolf-like creature, eviscerating and ripping his enemies to shreds whilst saving the lives of two of his terrified colleagues. But why has this happened, and what disturbing secret is the SAS Trooper withholding, a secret originating from within the darkest recesses of his boyhood past?
                        <br /><br />
                        For Ash Piper and the wolf inside him…are not alone.

                        The countdown to anarchy has begun and for NATO’s new breed of covert assassin, not only must he face a shocking world of violence, pain and torture, he must also confront his own horrifying past and a truly terrifying future.

A future that will lead NATO’s new breed of covert assassin and his colleagues on a gruelling, brutal game of predator and prey as they begin searching for clues with reference to a series of horrifying murders across the national parklands of Austria and France, Moscow, Paris and the Southern French coastal town of Banyuls-Sur-Mer, before fortuitous circumstance hurls Piper directly towards the Danish capital city of Copenhagen, where the truth behind the relentless war of nerves between himself and his own kind will begin to arise with untamed, unforgiving fury.

                    <h3>Resident 'Wolfman' Hopes For Major Success</h3>
                    <img src="images/author.jpg" alt="Ian Redman" class="pull-left" />
                    Ian Redman was one of the co-founders of Wolf Help, a British team who very successfully educated the public about the nature of wolves and wolf society. Ian was the speaker for the group who wrote and researched all of his WOLF HELP lectures and maintains regular contact with North America’s foremost biologists who constantly supported Ian’s efforts for Wolf Conservation.
                    <br /><br />
                    Ian has had several wolf articles published both in Britain and abroad and attributes the beginnings of his fascination with the wolf to a documentary he watched on TV in 1989 entitled ‘The Ice Pack’.
                    <br /><br />
                    Ian devotes his spare time to studying grey wolves, European Special Ops and the history and fighting tactics of the Waffen SS.
                    <br /><br />
                    RED HAZE is Ian’s second literary work, his first being a highly comprehensive wolf reference book called ‘Savage Freedom: The world of the wolf’ which was fully endorsed by The World Society For The Protection Of Animals (WSPA), selling copies in the UK and US.
                    <br /><br />
                    RED HAZE is the first story in a whole set of chronicles depicting the life and times of Ash Piper. Red Haze: A Werewolf Story for the 21st Century, is a very realistic novel. Everything from the pack of werewolves who Piper eventually begins to fight against, to the group of terrorists who bring unholy chaos to Europe are all thoroughly researched.
                    <br /><br />
                    The RED HAZE Chronicles are now available on the Amazon Kindle.
