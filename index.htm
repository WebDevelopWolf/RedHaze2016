                        <br /><br />
                        A Special Air Service Recon Team parachute behind enemy lines at the beginning of Operation Telic, the British controlled section of the second allied invasion of Iraq. Bloody mayhem and chaos ensue, with Piper suddenly, unexpectedly transforming into a horrifying wolf-like creature, eviscerating and ripping his enemies to shreds whilst saving the lives of two of his terrified colleagues. But why has this happened, and what disturbing secret is the SAS Trooper withholding, a secret originating from within the darkest recesses of his boyhood past?

A future that will lead NATO’s new breed of covert assassin and his colleagues on a gruelling, brutal game of predator and prey as they begin searching for clues with reference to a series of horrifying murders across the national parklands of Austria and France, Moscow, Paris and the Southern French coastal town of Banyuls-Sur-Mer, before fortuitous circumstance hurls Piper directly towards the Danish capital city of Copenhagen, where the truth behind the relentless war of nerves between himself and his own kind will begin to arise with untamed, unforgiving fury.

                    <h3>Resident 'Wolfman' Hopes For Major Success</h3>
                    <img src="images/author.jpg" alt="Ian Redman" class="pull-left" />
                    Ian Redman was one of the co-founders of Wolf HELP (Helping Education for Lobo Preservation), a British wolf conservation team who very successfully educated the public about the nature of wolves and wolf society. For over a decade Ian was the main researcher and speaker for the group whilst maintaining strong contacts with many of North America's foremost wolf research biologists, all of whom actively supported Ian and his team on their wolf conservation endeavours. 
                    <br /><br /><br />
                    Throughout the 1990s Ian travelled extensively during his wolf studies and he has spent time in the United States and Russia tracking and monitoring wolf packs utilising a variety of methods. He also took an active part in the Mexican Wolf Recovery Programme with his Wolf HELP colleague Neil Stevenson, thanks to a kind invitation from senior staff at Wolf Haven International. Here he assisted with the capture and vetinary care of eleven captive bred Mexican wolves, several of which were later released into the wild in the state of Arizona.
                    <br /><br /><br />
                    In his free time Ian still enjoys his wolf studies along with researching the history, weaponry and fighting tactics of Nazi Germany's Waffen SS units and modern day European, American and Russian Black Ops, all of which have led to his creation of 'The Red Haze Chronicles' espionage based werewolf series on the Amazon Kindle.
